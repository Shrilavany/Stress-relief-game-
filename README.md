Stress Relief Game
Overview
The Stress Relief Game is designed to help users manage stress through guided breathing exercises, meditation, and data analysis. This project focuses on promoting mental well-being by providing a relaxing, interactive experience that includes breathing techniques, meditation sessions, and feedback based on user performance. It also collects data to analyze the effectiveness of the exercises in reducing stress.

Features
Breathing Exercise: Guided "Breathe In, Breathe Out" sessions with automatic start and stop functionality.
Meditation Session: A one-minute meditation guided by an AI voice with relaxing background music and a countdown timer.
Data Collection: Data from user interactions is processed for analysis to understand their stress levels before and after the exercises.
Data Analysis: Provides insights into user performance through visual representations like charts or graphs, analyzing how effectively the exercises reduce stress.
User Feedback: Personalized feedback based on the analysis, helping users understand their progress in managing stress.

How It Works
1. Breathing Exercise
The breathing exercise is designed to guide users through a relaxing "Breathe In, Breathe Out" sequence, helping them calm their minds.

Automatic Timing: The exercise automatically starts and stops after completing three cycles of breathing.
AI Voice Prompts: Users are guided with AI voice prompts, instructing them when to breathe in and out.
Background: A light, human-acceptable, and mind-relaxing background color enhances the overall calming experience.
2. Meditation Session
The meditation session is a short, one-minute exercise aimed at grounding the user and promoting mental clarity.

Countdown Timer: A 60-second countdown is displayed as users are guided through the session.
Background Music: Calm and soothing music plays in the background.
AI Voice Guidance: At the start of the session, an AI voice explains the purpose and method of the meditation.
3. Data Collection and Processing
User Data: The game collects data such as breathing cycles completed, meditation session participation, and user feedback.
Data Storage: Data is stored in a JSON file (user_data.json) and processed to analyze the user's stress levels based on their interaction with the game.
Analysis Factors: The data collected includes the duration of each exercise, user feedback (if provided), and physiological responses (if recorded through other means like wearables).
4. Data Analysis
Once the exercises are completed, the game processes and analyzes the collected data to provide insights into how effective the exercises were in reducing stress.

Performance Metrics: Data such as the number of breathing cycles completed, relaxation time, and user feedback are used to measure effectiveness.
Visualization: The analysis page shows visual representations of the data using pie charts, bar graphs, and line charts.
Feedback Report: Users are given a personalized analysis based on the data, including suggestions for improving their stress management techniques.
